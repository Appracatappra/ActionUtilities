# Action Utilities

**Action Utilities** provide several useful functions that are common across many apps written in Swift such as getting the version of the OS installed on the device the app is running on, testing to see if an app can connect to the internet and getting the type of device the app is running on (for example `iPhoneX`).

The following utilities are available:

* [Action Extensions](#Action-Extensions) - Extend common, built-in Cocoa, Cocoa Touch and Swift data types.
* [General Utilities](#General-Utilities) - Add several, general utility classes to handle common tasks.
* [Hardware Utilities](#Hardware-Utilities) - Provide information about the device that an app is running on.
